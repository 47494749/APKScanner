# üîç APK & Code Analysis Tool by Luigi Origa

I often need to perform source code reviews, and since the code is confidential, I can't use "suspicious" programs to analyze it.  
Over time, I wrote this small tool to make searching for basic patterns a bit easier.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
It is not my intention to compete with professional tools dedicated to cybersecurity.  
My little program simply unpacks APKs, decompiles Java code, and tries to extract as much information as possible from what‚Äôs inside.
